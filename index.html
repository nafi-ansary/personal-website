        <p>I am not the most capable or smart person, but I make up to it with perseverance.I love to exercise my brain. It fascinates me what the human brain is capable of, and although I am limited to my own capabilities, I do not hesitate to learn as much as I can.I love learning about how our modern technology functions.  Programming is one of the most satisfying hobbies I currently have.</p></div>
